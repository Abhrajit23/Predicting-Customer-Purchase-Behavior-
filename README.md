Machine Learning Project: Predicting Customer Purchase Behavior
By: Abhrajit Das

🔍 Project Overview
This machine learning project focuses on predicting whether a customer will make a purchase based on features such as age, income, gender, marital status, and more. The goal is to use classification algorithms to uncover patterns in consumer behavior and improve marketing decision-making.

🧠 Problem Statement
Businesses often struggle to identify which potential customers are likely to convert. This project uses machine learning to help solve that problem, enabling smarter targeting and better resource allocation.

✅ Solution
The approach involves:

Cleaning and preprocessing structured data

Label encoding categorical features like Gender and Marital Status

Splitting the data into train/test sets

Applying and evaluating multiple ML classification models

📂 Dataset
The dataset contains features such as:

Age

Estimated Salary

Gender

Marital Status

Purchase Label (target variable: 1 for purchased, 0 for not purchased)

🤖 Models Implemented
Logistic Regression

Random Forest Classifier

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Naive Bayes

📊 Evaluation Metrics
Accuracy Score

Confusion Matrix
